Set up coding for compact and reconfigurable manufacturing platform for the continuous-flow synthesis and formulation of APIs.


The suit platform must be equipped with devices for real-time monitoring and final formulation of high purity APIs. For the preparation of target molecules, commercially available starting materials may be employed.
It must be able to perform complex multistep synthesis, work-up procedures as well as purification operations such as crystallization. 
The project is designed for Synthesisable Accessibility, Avoid MTA from CROs, Issue tracking, Automatic bug reports and User feedback.
The material in each module is typically based on customized flow equipment, or retrofitted synthesis glassware, connected using chemical-resistant polytetrafluoroethylene tubing for pumps transfer reaction mixtures between each module. 
Quality control may have In-line analysis to collect high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS)100,149, NMR144, infrared and UV spectroscopy, pH.
